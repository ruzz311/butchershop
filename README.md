butchershop
===========

Butchershop is an workbench of sorts that leverages hapijs module to help you develop front-end code 
using local assets with a remote server.  Basically a reverse-proxy site where you can "chop" in 
assets that need development.  This project was developed out of a ton of fustration working with a 
team who's static assets were coupled too tightly with a .NET project and my ever-growing hatrid for 
Visual Studio.
